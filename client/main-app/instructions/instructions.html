  <p class="normal-text">Your space colony is quickly running out of resources and must find a new world that can sustain life. There is rumor of a newly discovered habitable world in the Corealus nebula and colony leadership has narrowed it down to three possible planets. With limited fuel, you must plot a course to the colony's only hope of survival, but...</p>
  <p class="normal-text">THERE IS A TRAITOR AMONG YOU!</p>
  <p class="normal-text">A space pirate has infiltrated the leadership council. They will do everything in their power to lure you away from the new world, leaving the colony weak, exposed, and ripe for pilfering. Will you be able to lead your people to saftey, or will the space pirates succeed in their diaboical plot?</p>

      <li>
        <h3>Game Board</h3>
        <p>The game board is a grid that contains one start intersection and three planets.  The planets are seven columns away from the start and separated from each other by one row.</p>
        <p>The bottom row contains the discard area, your player hand with selectable tiles and the current special cards played against you (see below), and your role in the game(see Roles), settler or pirate!</p>
        <p>The top row contains the special cards played against the other players.</p>

      <li>
        <h3>Taking Your Turn</h3>
        <p>Your turn will be designated in the game feed and when your video is highlighted. To take your turn, drag a tile from your hand and place it on the board. Some route tiles are flippable to obtain a different orientation. To flip a route, simply click the tile before you drag and drop it. Once your turn is complete, you will automatically be dealt another tile if any remain in the deck.</p>
        <p>A route is valid only if it touches a tile that has already been placed</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <h1 class="title-text">Roles</h2>
    <p>At the start of the game, all four players will be given a secret role in the bottom right corner of their game.  Three players will be assigned the role of settler. Their goal will be to place tile routes to complete a consecutive path from the space station to the correct planet. The planets ability to sustain life will be unknown to all settlers when the game starts. The other player will be the pirate. The pirate will know the location of the planet from the begining. The pirates goal is to stop the settlers from reaching the correct planet.  If the settlers reach the planet, they win. If they run out of routes, the pirate has succeeded!</p>
